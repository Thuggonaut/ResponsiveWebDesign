# nav element
- used to define a section of a webpage that contains navigation links. It helps to group together links that allow users to navigate through different sections of the website or application.


# navigate to different sections
- In HTML, the # symbol in an anchor (<a>) tag's href attribute is used to create a link to a specific section within the same page. It refers to an element with a corresponding id attribute.
- This allows users to jump to different sections of the same page without reloading it.
- e.g.
```html
<li><a href="#student-info">INFO</a></li>
<li><a href="#html-questions">HTML</a></li>
<li><a href="#css-questions">CSS</a></li>
```
