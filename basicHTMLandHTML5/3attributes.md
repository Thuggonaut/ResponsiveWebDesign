# src attribute
- src is short for source
- Used to specify the URL of the image you want to display
- For example:
```html
<img src="image.jpg" alt="Description of image">
```

```html
<img src="https://cdn.freecodecamp.org/curriculum/cat-photo-app/relaxing-cat.jpg" alt="relaxing cat>"
```

# alt attribute
- alt is short for alternative
- The text inside an alt attribute is used for screen readers to improve accessibility and is displayed if the image fails to load.

# Adding an image
- img elements are void elements - they don't have a closing tag
- All img elements must have an alt attribute
- If the image is purely decorative, using an empty alt attribute is a best practice.
