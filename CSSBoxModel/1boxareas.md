# Box areas
- In the CSS Box model, every HTML element is a box with four areas
	- the content: a header, paragraph, or image element ![alt text](1image.png) as an "object"
	- the padding: the space surrounding the content, as "bubble wrap"
	- the border: as "cardboard box" holding the item and bubble wrap ![alt text](2image.png)
	- the margin: the area outside of the box, and can be used to control the space between other boxes or elements. ![alt text](3image.png)
		- Here the bottom element has a larger top margin, pushing it further down the page.
